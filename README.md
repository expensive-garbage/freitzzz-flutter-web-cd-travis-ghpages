## Requirements

- Github account and a repository to host the built web application files
- TravisCI account

## Setup

Before setting up the pipeline on Travis and creating the Flutter Web application, it is necessary to decide which branching model is to be adopted as this decision influences the pipeline design. As this example serves as a guide on how to integrate Flutter Web and TravisCI, a single branch model (Trunk Based Development) will be used.
